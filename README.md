## 🛠️ How to Use

Each folder corresponds to a topic. Inside, you’ll find `.py` files for each problem with:
- Problem name and link
- My solution
- Optional time and space complexity notes

Example:
```python
# 1. Two Sum
# https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
# Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hash_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in hash_map:
            return [hash_map[diff], i]
        hash_map[num] = i
